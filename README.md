# Logistic-Regression-to-Predict-Cancer-Risk

The project objective is to predict the probability of someone getting cancer based on a given data set containing some medical history information for patients at risk for cancer. Each patient in the data set has been diagnosed their actual cancer status. I built classifiers predicting whether a patient has cancer based on other features of that patient.
